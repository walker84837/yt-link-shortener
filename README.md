## Features

- Enter a YouTube link in the input field.

## What's Different?

This application takes a YouTube link as input and provides a shortened version of the link. It handles different types of YouTube links, including regular video links and YouTube Shorts links.

The link conversion process is done dynamically using JavaScript, which means the conversion happens on the client-side without making any server requests.
